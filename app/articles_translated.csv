公开资料显示，高飞在金融市场司历任副巡视员、副司长等职。2023年7月，高飞以金融市场司副司长的身份出席了在香港和上海同步举行的“债券通周年论坛2023”。高飞当时表示，要积极研究推进债券市场对外开放的其他举措，包括进一步提升制度型统一对外开放水平，探索建立境外投资者投资境内债券市场的托管行模式；完善境外投资者的风险对冲工具与流动性管理工具。
高飞当时还称，除已经推出的“互换通”之外，积极研究针对境外投资者比较关注的回购交易问题；探索推动境外投资者持有的人民币债券在离岸成为可广泛接受的合格担保品，试点境外投资者在直接入市渠道下参与标准债券远期业务等；优化“南向通”运行机制，有序推动境内基础设施与国际基础设施开展跨境合作等。
两年多过去，债券市场对外开放成效显著。2025年7月，在“债券通周年论坛2025”上，中国人民银行和香港金管局宣布了多项债券通优化扩容的措施，包括将扩大“南向通”参与机构范围，加入券商、保险公司、理财及资产管理公司；将拓宽离岸回购应用场景，可交易币种由人民币拓宽至美元、欧元、港元等多币种；优化互换通运行机制，进一步满足投资者的利率风险管理需求等。
2025年9月，中国人民银行、中国证监会、国家外汇局联合发布公告，支持可在中国债券市场开展债券现券交易的境外机构投资者开展债券回购业务。截至2025年8月末，共有来自80个国家和地区的1170家境外机构进入中国债券市场，持债总量约4万亿元人民币。
一国货币国际化的程度通常与该国债券市场发展的国际化程度密切相关。高飞履新交易中心党委书记后，将继续推动境内外金融基础设施互联互通，不断增强境内金融市场国际化属性，以市场高质量发展、高水平开放服务人民币国际化。
交易中心是中国人民银行直属单位，是我国金融市场重要基础设施，以建设“全球人民币及相关产品交易主平台和定价中心”为目标，为我国银行间外汇市场、货币市场、债券市场等现货及衍生产品提供发行、交易、交易后处理、信息、基准、数据和投资者教育等金融交易业务服务。

Public data shows that Gao Fei has held various positions such as deputy supervisor, deputy director, etc. at the Financial Market Authority. In July 2023, Gao Fei attended the ""Bond Connect Anniversary Forum 2023"" held simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shanghai as the deputy director of the Financial Market Authority. At the time, Gao Fei expressed his willingness to actively research and promote the opening up of the bond market to the outside world, including further improving the level of institutionalized unified opening up, exploring the establishment of a custody bank model for foreign investors to invest in the domestic bond market; perfecting risk hedging tools and liquidity management tools for foreign investors.
At the time, Gao Fei also mentioned that, in addition to the ""Interbank Bond Market"" that had already been launched, they were actively researching the issue of reverse repurchase transactions that foreign investors were particularly concerned about; they were exploring the possibility of making renminbi bonds held by foreign investors in offshore markets widely accepted as eligible collateral, and piloting foreign investors' participation in direct entry channels for standard long-term bonds; optimizing the operating mechanism of ""Southbound Bond Connect"", and promoting cross-border cooperation between domestic infrastructure and international infrastructure in an orderly manner.
Two years have passed since the bond market was opened to the outside world, with remarkable results. In July 2025, at the ""Bond Connect Anniversary Forum 2025"", the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced several measures to optimize and expand Bond Connect, including expanding the scope of participating institutions in the ""Southbound"" to include securities companies, insurance companies, asset management companies, and financial institutions; broadening the scope of offshore repurchase applications, allowing for the trading of multiple currencies including the US dollar, euro, and Hong Kong dollar; optimizing the operating mechanism of the exchange, and further meeting the interest rate risk management needs of investors, etc. [IMAGE:...]
In 2025 September, the People's Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange jointly issued a notice, supporting foreign institutional investors that are allowed to engage in bond spot trading on the Chinese bond market to conduct bond repurchase business. As of August 2025, a total of 1,170 foreign institutions from 80 countries and regions have entered the Chinese bond market, holding a total of approximately 40 trillion yuan in bonds.
The degree of internationalization of a country's currency is usually closely related to the degree of internationalization of its bond market. After taking office as the secretary of the Party Committee of the High-Flying Fulian Transaction Center, he will continue to promote the mutual connection and mutual benefit of domestic and foreign financial infrastructure, constantly enhancing the internationalization attributes of the domestic financial market, and promoting the high-quality development and high-level opening-up of the renminbi's internationalization through market-oriented services.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is the parent unit of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, which is a major financial infrastructure in the country.
The transaction center also bears the responsibility of daily monitoring of market transactions and the secretariat work of the self-regulatory mechanism for the national foreign exchange market and the self-regulatory mechanism for the interbank market, and is authorized to release the midpoint rate of the renminbi, the renminbi exchange rate index, the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor), the bond repurchase rate (DR) between deposit-taking financial institutions, the lending market quotation rate (LPR), and the renminbi reference rate, thereby providing support and services for the operation and transmission of monetary policy and the implementation of macro-prudential regulation and other policies.
According to the official website, the current leadership team of the trading center consists of party committee secretary Gao Fei, chairman Zhang Yi, disciplinary committee secretary Ren Jiankang, and four vice chairmen, namely Li Ruoyong, Hu Jian, Dong Yiwie, and Li Meijing.",https://img.huanqiucdn.cn/dp/api/files/imageDir/eaaba3febcd834e6ecd48a496b6808bf.png,https://m.huanqiu.com/article/4OwsQhxR5g0
